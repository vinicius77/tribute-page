        <h1>Ayrton Senna da Silva</h1>
        <p>
          Ayrton Senna was a legend in his own lifetime. A man so dedicated to
          his profession that nothing, it seemed, could ever stop him. Senna was
          charismatic, strong-willed, forceful and seldom vulnerable. Behind the
          wheel of a racing car he exhibited a ‘magic’ rarely, if ever before
          seen. Looking for a crack in Senna’s armour became a hobby for some
          people. It proved an unrewarding pastime.
