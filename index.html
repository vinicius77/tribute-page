        <h1>Ayrton Senna da Silva</h1>
        <p>
          Ayrton Senna da Silva (Brazilian Portuguese: [aˈiʁtõ ˈsẽnɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ]
          (About this soundlisten); 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian
          racing driver who won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in
          1988, 1990 and 1991. Senna is one of three Formula One drivers from
          Brazil to win the World Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65
          pole positions, with the latter being the record until 2006.

          Ayrton Senna was a legend in his own lifetime. A man so dedicated to
          his profession that nothing, it seemed, could ever stop him. Senna was
          charismatic, strong-willed, forceful and seldom vulnerable. Behind the
          wheel of a racing car he exhibited a ‘magic’ rarely, if ever before
          seen. Looking for a crack in Senna’s armour became a hobby for some
          people. It proved an unrewarding pastime.
